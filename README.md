Sign up/Sign In page, Contacact:
this page was created by Sarthak Ahuja. while createing this page he has used form validation technique. Form validation commonly used to occur at the server, after the client had entered all the necessary data and then pressed the Submit button. If the data entered by a client was incorrect or was simply missing, the server would have to send all the data back to the client and request that the form is resubmitted with the correct information. This was a lengthy process that puts a lot of burden on the server. REact provides a way to validate form data on the client's computer before sending it to the web server. Form validation generally performs two functions. Basic Validation − First of all, the form must be checked to make sure all the mandatory fields are filled in. It would require just a loop through each field in the form and checking for data. Data Format Validation − Secondly, the data that is entered must be checked for the correct form and value. Your code must include appropriate logic to test the correctness of data.
